 '<p>So, I did search google and SO prior to asking this question. Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can\'t for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won\'t be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.</p>\n\n<pre><code>CLass Blah\n{\n        [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "SystemParametersInfo")]\n        public static extern bool SystemParametersInfo(uint uiAction, uint uiParam, uint pvParam, uint fWinIni);\n\n        [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "SetForegroundWindow")]\n        public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);\n\n        [DllImport("User32.dll", EntryPoint = "ShowWindowAsync")]\n        private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int cmdShow);\n        private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL = 1;\n\n    public void ShowMessage(string msg)\n    {\n            MessageForm msgFrm = new MessageForm();\n            msgFrm.lblMessage.Text = "FOO";\n            msgFrm.ShowDialog();\n            msgFrm.BringToFront();\n            msgFrm.TopMost = true;\n            msgFrm.Activate();\n\n            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 0, 0, 0x0002 | 0x0001);\n            ShowWindowAsync(msgFrm.Handle, WS_SHOWNORMAL);\n            SetForegroundWindow(msgFrm.Handle);\n            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 200000, 200000, 0x0002 | 0x0001);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I say I\'m sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it\'s own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>msgFrm.ShowDialog();\nmsgFrm.BringToFront();\nmsgFrm.Focus();\nApplication.DoEvents();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The form still comes up <em>under</em> the Powershell session. I\'ll proceed with working out the threading. I\'ve spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we\'ll see how it goes.</p>\n\n<p>Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I\'m not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I\'m stuck with polling.</p>\n',

 '<p>I have just started working with the <code>AnimationExtender</code>.  I am using it to show a new div with a list gathered from a database when a button is pressed.

The postback however stops the animation mid flow and resets it.  The button is within an update panel.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally I would want the animation to start once the postback is complete and the list has been gathered.

Iâ\x80\x99m still get some animation stutter.  The animation starts to play before the postback and then plays properly after postback.  Using the <code>onclkBehavior.pause()</code> has no effect.

This however works only once as now the AnimationExtender is enabled again.

The others are measurements of complexity and readability, which really has nothing to do with quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apart from the fact that I don\'t agree with this statement at all, it got me thinking.</p>\n\n<p>When I have to review code that has hardly any associated tests, whether unit, system or integration, I tend to approach the code much, much more warily than if I see a good suite of tests that have been successfully passed.</p>\n\n<p>Same thing when performing security audits on code. If I see unused variables, huge functions, bizarre mixtures of configs, per server, per dir, etc. being used in Apache modules it also predisposes me to approach the code very warily.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else use this initial "gut feeling" approach and does it affect the outcome?</p>\n\n<p>BTW I don\'t agree with Kris\'s comment because all the other metrics are definitely valid measures that will help highlight badly designed, poorly executed code.

 '<p>I run a rather complex project with several independent applications. These use however a couple of shared components. So I have a source tree looking something like the below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My Project \n<ul>\n<li>Application A</li>\n<li>Shared1</li>\n<li>Shared2 </li>\n<li>Application B </li>\n<li>Application C</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All applications have their own MSBuild script that builds the project and all the shared resources it needs. I also run these builds on a CruiseControl controlled continuous integration build server. </p>\n\n<p>When the applications are deployed they are deployed on several servers to distribute load. This means that itâ\x80\x99s <em>extremely</em> important to keep track of what build/revision is deployed on each of the different servers (we need to have the current version in the DLL version, for example â\x80\x9c1.0.0.68â\x80\x9d). </p>\n\n<p>Itâ\x80\x99s equally important to be able to recreate a revision/build that been built to be able to roll back if something didnâ\x80\x99t work out as intended (o yes, that happends ...). Today weâ\x80\x99re using SourceSafe for source control but that possible to change if we could present good reasons for that (SS itâ\x80\x99s actually working ok for us <em>so</em> far). </p>\n\n<p>Another principle that we try to follow is that itâ\x80\x99s only code that been build and tested by the integration server that we deploy further. </p>\n\n<h2>"CrusieControl Build Labels" solution</h2>\n\n<p>We had several ideas on solving the above. The first was to have the continuous integration server build and locally deploy the project and test it (it does that now). As you probably know a successful build in CruiseControl generates a build label and I guess we somehow could use that to set the DLL version of our executables (so build label 35 would create a DLL like â\x80\x9c1.0.0.35â\x80\x9d )? The idea was also to use this build label to label the <strong>complete</strong> source tree. Then we probably could check out by that label and recreate the build later on. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for labeling the complete tree is to include not only the actual application code (thatâ\x80\x99s in one place in the source tree) but also all the shared items (thatâ\x80\x99s in different places in the tree). So a successful build of â\x80\x9cApplication Aâ\x80\x9d would label to whole tree with label â\x80\x9cApplicationA35â\x80\x9d for example. </p>\n\n<p>There might however be an issue when trying to recreate this build and setting the DLL version before deploying as we then donâ\x80\x99t have access to the CruiseControl generated build label anymore. If all CrusieControl build labels were unique for all the projects we could use only the number for labeling but thatâ\x80\x99s not the case (both application A and B could at the same time be on build 35) so we have to include the application name in the label. Hence SourceSafe label â\x80\x9cApplication35â\x80\x9d. <strong>How can I then recreate build 34 and set 1.0.0.34 to the DLL version numbers once we built build 35?</strong></p>\n\n<h2>"Revision number" solution</h2>\n\n<p>Someone told me that Subversion for example creates a revision number for the entire source tree on every check in â\x80\x93 <strong>is this the case? Has SourceSafe something similar?</strong> If this is correct the idea is then to grab that revision number when getting latest and build on the CruiseControl server. The revision number could then be used to set the DLL version number (to for example â\x80\x9c1.0.0.5678â\x80\x9d). I guess we could then get this specific revision for the Subversion if needed and that then would include that application and all the shared items to be able to recreate a specific version from the past. <strong>Would that work and could this also be achived using SourceSafe?</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Summarize</h2>\n\n<p>So the two main requirements are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Be able to <strong>track build/revision number of the build and deployed DLL.</strong></li>\n<li>Be able to <strong>rebuild a past revision/build, set the old build/revision number on the executables of that build</strong> (to comply with requirement 1).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>So how would you solve this?</strong> What would be your preferred approach and <strong>how</strong> would you solve it (or do you have a totally different idea?)? **Pleased give detailed answers. **</p>\n\n<p><em>Bonus question</em> What are the difference between a revision number and a build number and when would one really need both?</p>\n',

Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>\n\n<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything.

 '<p>I hope everyone will pardon the length, and narrative fashion, of this question.  I decided to describe the situation in some detail in my blog.  I later saw Joel\'s invitation to this site, and I thought I\'d paste it here to see if anyone has any insight into the situation.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote, and now support, an application that consists of a Visual Basic thick client speaking DCOM to middle tier COM+ components written in C++ using ATL. It runs in all eight of our offices.  Each office hosts a back-end server that contains the COM+ application (consisting of 18 separate components) and the SQLServer. The SQLServer is typically on the same back-end server, but need not be.</p>\n\n<p>We recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- New York -- from a MSC cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on VMWare\'s ESX technology. Since the location of the COM+ application had moved from the old server to a new one with a different name, I had to redirect all the clients so that they activated the COM+ application on the new server. The procedure was old hat as I had done essentially the same thing for several of my smaller offices that had gone through similar infrastructure upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>All seemed routine and on Monday morning the entire office -- about 1,000 Windows XP workstations -- were running without incident on the new server. But then the call came from my mobile group -- there was an attorney working from home with a VPN connection that was getting a strange error after being redirected to the new server:</p>\n\n<pre>\nError on FillTreeView2 - The stub received bad data.\n</pre>\n\n<p>Huh? I had never seen this error message before. Was it the new server? But all the workstations in the office were working fine. I told the mobile group to switch the attorney back to the old sever (which was still up), and the error disappeared. So what was the difference? Turns out this attorney was running Vista at home.</p>\n\n<p>We don\'t run Vista in any of our offices, but we do have some attorneys that run Vista at home (certainly some in my New York office). I do as well and I\'ve never seen this problem. To confirm that there was an issue, I fired up my Vista laptop, pointed it to the new server, and got the same error. I pointed it back to the old server, and it worked fine. Clearly there was some problem with Vista and the components on the new server -- a problem that did not seem to affect XP clients. What could it be?</p>\n\n<p>Next stop -- the application error log on my laptop. This yielded more information on the error:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSource:        Microsoft-Windows-RPC-Events\nDate:          9/2/2008 11:56:07 AM\nEvent ID:      10\nLevel:         Error\nComputer:      DevLaptop\nDescription:   Application has failed to complete a COM call because an incorrect\ninterface ID was passed as a parameter.\n\nThe expected Interface ID was 00000555-0000-0010-8000-00aa006d2ea4, \nThe Interface ID returned was 00000556-0000-0010-8000-00aa006d2ea4.\n\nUser Action - Contact the application vendor for updated version of the application.\n</pre>\n\n<p>The interface ids provided the clue I needed to unravel the mystery. The "expected" interface id identifies MDAC\'s Recordset interface -- specifically version 2.1 of that interface. The "returned" interface corresponds to a later version of Recordset (version 2.5 which differs from version 2.1 by the inclusion of one additional entry at the end of the vtable -- method Save).</p>\n\n<p>Indeed my component\'s interfaces expose many methods that pass Recordset as an output parameter. So were they suddenly returning a later version of Recordset -- with a different interface id? It certainly appeared to be the case. And then I thought, why should it matter. The vtable looks the same to clients of the older interface. Indeed, I suspect that if we were talking about in-process COM, and not DCOM, this apparently innocuous impedance mismatch would have been silently ignored and would have caused no issues.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, when process and machine boundaries come into play, there is a proxy and a stub between the client and the server. In this case, I was using type library marshaling with the free threaded marshaller. So there were two mysteries to solve:</p>\n\n<p>Why was I returning a different interface in the output parameters from methods on my new server?</p>\n\n<p>Why did this affect only Vista clients?</p>\n\n<p>As my server software was hosted on servers at each of my eight offices, I decided to try pointing my Vista client at all of them in sequence to see which had problems with Vista and which didn\'t. Illuminating test. Some of the older servers still worked with Vista but the newer ones did not. Although some of the older servers were still running Windows 2000 while the newer ones were at 2003, that did not seem to be the issue.</p>\n\n<p>After comparing the dates of the component DLLs it appeared that whenever the client pointed to servers with component DLLs dated before 2003 Vista was fine. But those that had DLLs with dates after 2003 were problematic. Believe it or nor, there were no (or at least no significant) changes to the code on the server components in many years. Apparently the differing dates were simply due to recompiles of my components on my development machine(s). And it appeared that one of those recompiles happened in 2003.</p>\n\n<p>The light bulb went on. When passing Recordsets back from server to client, my ATL C++ components refer to the interface as _Recordset. This symbol comes from the type library embedded within msado15.dll. This is the line I had in the C++ code:</p>\n\n<pre>\n#import "c:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\System\\ADO\\msado15.dll" no_namespace rename ( "EOF", "adoEOF" )\n</pre>\n\n<p>Don\'t be deceived by the 15 in msdad15.dll. Apparently this DLL has not changed name in the long series of MDAC versions.</p>\n\n<p>When I compiled the application back in the day, the version of MDAC was 2.1. So _Recordset compiled with the 2.1 interface id and that is the interface returned by the servers running those components.</p>\n\n<p>All the client\'s use the COM+ application proxy that was generated (I believe) back in 1999. The type library that defines my interfaces includes the line:</p>\n\n<pre>\nimportlib("msado21.tlb");\n</pre>\n\n<p>which explains why they expect version 2.1 of Recordset in my method\'s output parameters. Clearly the problem was with my 2003 recompile and the fact that at that time the _Recordset symbol no longer corresponded to version 2.1. Indeed _Recordset corresponded to the 2.5 version with its distinct interface id. The solution for me was to change all references from _Recordset to Recordset21 in my C++ code. I rebuilt the components and deployed them to the new server. Voila -- the clients seemed happy again.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, there are two nagging questions that remain for me.</p>\n\n<p>Why does the proxy/stub infrastructure seem to behave differently with Vista clients? It appears that Vista is making stricter checks of the interface ids coming back from method parameters than is XP.</p>\n\n<p>How should I have coded this differently back in 1999 so that this would not have happened? Interfaces are supposed to be immutable and when I recompiled under a newer version of MDAC, I inadvertently changed my interface because the methods now returned a different Recordset interface as an output parameter. As far as I know, the type library back then did not have a version-specific symbol -- that is, later versions of the MDAC type libraries define Recordset21, but that symbol was not available back in the 2.1 type library.</p>\n',

 '<p>I have an SQL Server database where I have the data and log files stored on an external USB drive.  I switch the external drive between my main development machine in my office and my laptop when not in my office.  I am trying to use sp_detach_db and sp_attach_db when moving between desktop and laptop machines.  I find that this works OK on the desktop - I can detach and reattach the database there no problems.  But on the laptop I cannot reattach the database (the database was actually originally created on the laptop and the first detach happened there).  When I try to reattach on the laptop I get the following error:</p>\n\n<p>Unable to open the physical file "p:\\SQLData\\AppManager.mdf". Operating system error 5: "5(error not found)"</p>\n\n<p>I find a lot of references to this error all stating that it is a permissions issue.  So I went down this path and made sure that the SQL Server service account has appropriate permissions.  I have also created a new database on this same path and been able to succesfully detach and reattach it.  So I am confident permissions is not the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Further investigation reveals that I cannot rename, copy or move the data files as Windows thinks they are locked - even when the SQL Server service is stopped.  Process Explorer does not show up any process locking the files.  </p>\n\n<p>How can I find out what is locking the files and unlock them.</p>\n\n<p>I have verified that the databases do not show up in SSMS - so SQL Server does not still think they exist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 18/09/2008</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have tried all of the suggested answers to date with no success.  However trying these suggestions has helped to clarify the situation.  I can verify the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I can successfully detach and reattach the database only when the external drive is attached to the server that a copy of the database is restored to - effectively the server where the database is "created" - lets call this the "Source Server".  </li>\n<li>I can move, copy or rename the data and log files, after detaching the database, while the external drive is still attached to the Source Server.  </li>\n<li>As soon as I move the external drive to another machine the data and log files are "locked", although the 2 tools that I have tried - Process Explorer and Unlocker, both find no locking handles attached to the files. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>NB.  After detaching the database I tried both stopping the SQL Server service and shutting down the Source Server prior to moving the external drive - still with no success.</p>\n\n<p>So at this stage all that I can do to move data between desktop and laptop is to make a backup of the data onto the external drive, move the external drive, restore the data from the backup.  Works OK but takes a bit more time as the database is a reasonable size (1gb).  Anyway this is the only choice I have at this stage even though I was trying to avoid having to go down this path.</p>\n',
